# Nand2Tetris

This repository contains my hardware and software projects for each module of Nand2Tetris.

Nand2Tetris is a project-oriented applied computer science course that guides students through the construction of a modern, full-scale computer system from the ground up.

The following topics are covered in this comprehensive course:
-Hardware
-Architecture
-Operating Systems
-Programming Languages
-Compilers
-Data Structures and Algorithms
-Software Engineering

Projects Overview:
-4 hardware-related projects, built using a Hardware Description Language (HDL) and simulated on a supplied hardware simulator. 
-5 software projects (assembler, virtual machine I and II, and compiler I and II), which could be written in any programming language (Python).
-3 additional projects (low-level programming, high-level programming, and the operating system), written in the assembly language and high-level language implemented in previous projets.
