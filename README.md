# Nand2Tetris

This repository contains my hardware and software projects for each module of Nand2Tetris.

Nand2Tetris is a project-oriented applied computer science course that guides students through the construction of a modern, full-scale computer system from the ground up.

The following topics are covered in this comprehensive course:
<ul>
<li>Hardware<li>
<li>Architecture<li>
<li>Operating Systems<li>
<li>Programming Languages<li>
<li>Compilers<li>
<li>Data Structures and Algorithms<li>
<li>Software Engineering<li>
</ul>

Projects Overview:
<ul>
<li>4 hardware-related projects, built using a Hardware Description Language (HDL) and simulated on a supplied hardware simulator</li> 
<li>5 software projects (assembler, virtual machine I and II, and compiler I and II), which could be written in any programming language (Python).</li>
<li>3 additional projects (low-level programming, high-level programming, and the operating system), written in the assembly language and high-level language implemented in previous projets.</li>
</ul>
